This repo is a bit of a mess, most of my solutions are janky at best, and most of the solutions from the early days that I wrote initially (in failed attempts at solving the problem quickly) are partially commented out or deleted. The library I'm using for the tacit stuff from 2024 day 10 onwards is my own [tacit-js](https://tobyck.github.io/tacit-js).
