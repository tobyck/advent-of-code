This repo is a bit of a mess, most of my solutions are janky at best, and most of the solutions from the early days that I wrote initially (in failed attempts at solving the problem quickly) are partially commented out or deleted. If there's anything useful here it's probably lib.js which has a much of useful methods/functions and a couple of proxies that let you do some slightly cursed tacit stuff.
