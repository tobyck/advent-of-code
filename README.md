This repo is a bit of a mess, most of my solutions are janky at best, and most of the solutions frop the early days that I wrote initially (in failed attempts at solving the problem quickly) are partially commented out or deleted. If there's anything useful here it's probably lib.js (modelled heavily on [hyperneutrino's one](https://github.com/hyperneutrino/aoc-js/blob/master/header.js)) which has a much of useful methods/functions and a couple of proxies that let you do some slightly cursed tacit stuff.
